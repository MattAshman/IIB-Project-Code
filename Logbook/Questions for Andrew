Questions to ask:
What are the signs of fractionation? Can Andrew detect fractionation in the different patients? (Show data from first file of each patient (i.e. a01, b01, c01) using display_data.py. If, for a given patient, he claims to be able to see it in a particular channel then compare that channel across all input files for that same patient using display_channel.py. (For example, look at the variation across the same channel for the files of patient b. Why are they so different?).
Why does the signal look so different patient to patient? Use compare_channel.py to compare the same channel for two different patients. (For example compare channel CS3-4 across patients 'a' and 'g'. What is going on?).
Does channel 9-10 (same as channel CSp) show the moment at which S1/S2 pulses are delivered? (This is so we can use this cannel for pulse detection).
